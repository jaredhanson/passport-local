# Passport-Local

[Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) strategy for authenticating
with a local username and password.

## Installation

    $ npm install passport-local

## Usage

#### Configure Strategy

The local authentication strategy authenticates users using a username and
password.  The strategy requires a `verify` callback, which accepts these
credentials and calls `done` providing a user.

    passport.use(new LocalStrategy(
      function(username, password, done) {
        User.findOne({ username: username }, function (err, user) {
          if (err) { return done(err); }
          if (!user) { return done(null, false); }
          if (!user.verifyPassword(password)) { return done(null, false); }
          return done(null, user);
        });
      }
    ));

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'local'` strategy, to
authenticate requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
application:

    app.post('/login', 
      passport.authenticate('local', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
      function(req, res) {
        res.redirect('/');
      });
